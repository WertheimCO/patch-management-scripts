# patch-management-scripts

In this example, the script checks for available system updates using the apt-get command and installs them if the user confirms. Note that this script is specifically designed for systems that use the apt-get package manager, and would need to be modified for other systems.

The script also checks if it is running with root privileges, since installing updates requires administrative access. If the script is not running with root privileges, it prints an error message and exits.

Note that this is a simple example and a complete patch management system would need to be more sophisticated and robust, with additional features such as automatic update scheduling and rollback functionality. However, this should give you a general idea of how to get started with patch management in Python.
